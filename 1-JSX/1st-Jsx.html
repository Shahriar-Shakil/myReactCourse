  /* Define an HTML Class in JSX
   So far, it may seem that HTML and JSX are exactly the same.
   One key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word class to define HTML classes.
   This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses className.
   In fact, the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase.
    For example, a click event in JSX is onClick, instead of onclick.

 unordered list (<ul>) to the page. The list should contain 3 list items
 (<li>) with anything in them you want.
